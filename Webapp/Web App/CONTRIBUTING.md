## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- Git
- Firebase account
- Google Cloud Console account (for API access)

### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/health-monitoring-dashboard.git`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure your environment variables
5. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code formatting and structure
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Ensure responsive design for all UI components

### Component Structure
```typescript
// Preferred component structure
"use client" // Only if needed

import { useState, useEffect } from "react"
import { motion } from "framer-motion"
// ... other imports

interface ComponentProps {
  // Define props with TypeScript
}

export default function Component({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentProps) {
  // State and hooks
  const [state, setState] = useState()
  
  // Effects
  useEffect(() => {
    // Effect logic
  }, [dependencies])
  
  // Event handlers
  const handleEvent = () => {
    // Handler logic
  }
  
  // Render
  return (
    <motion.div
      // Framer Motion animations
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
    >
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </motion.div>
  )
}
```

### Animation Guidelines
- Use Framer Motion for all animations
